/// This macro is intended to be used in all cases where we get Result<T, U> and want to convert it

/// #Examples
///
/// ```
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate safe_ffi;
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate safe_client;
/// fn f() -> i32 {
///     let some_result: Result<String, safe_client::errors::ClientError> = Ok("Hello".to_string());
///     let string_length = ffi_try!(some_result).len();
///     assert_eq!(string_length, 5);

/// }
/// # fn main() {
/// # let error_code = f();
